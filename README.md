To build: npm install

To run: npm start

A few of the ES6 (or whatever you prefer to call it) features that I have included:
- Classes
- Destructure
  It's a much cleaner way to alias things
- Default Parameters
- Object spread operator
  It was a convenient way to adhere to the immutability that's needed for redux
